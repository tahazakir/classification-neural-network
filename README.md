# classification-neural-network
An artificial neural network for the purpose of classifying
clothing items in the popular MNIST dataset. 
Current accuracy is 98% and the numba library has been used for run-time optimizations.
Phase 1 is a neural network implementation based on For Loops.
Phase 2 is a neural network implementation using vectorization
Phase 3 implementation is based on a custom dataset which was created by taking pictures of various objects around the house.
